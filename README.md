My vision here:

    leetcode has a nice problem set to crack the coding interview, the problems can be hard to solve, but they are rare convoluted. Has nice auto-tests. Can be a fast lane to practice coding for interviews.

    geekforgeeks has a very similar problem set to leetcode, but every problem usually starts from an explanatory article. Good for learning about algorithms and new techniques.

    hackerrank - has a lot of programming problems, as well as math, AI, etc problems. But programming problems there are rather intentionally convoluted since they are primarily for the programming contests. People doing contests regularly are very good at pattern matching and can map a problem to a solution very fast, so they need to be distracted a bit by introducing some indirect problem statements. So, IMO hackerrank is not that helpful in cracking the coding interviews, but is very valuable just for improving problem solving skills.

    codeforces - very similar to hackerrank, but with more focus on conducting programming contests. But it does have a huge problems archive and auto-tests.

    topcoder - for programming contests professionals.

    rosettacode - how to implement X in language Y. Very interesting compilation of standard problems and corresponding solutions.

    codingame - automated platform for writing game bots and alike. Can be very fun, with nice visualization and competitive features. Definitely improve your coding and math skills but solutions often are heuristic-based.
